Some spells and attacks cause the target to become primed. While primed, if the target is hit with a detonating spell or attack
the primed condition ends and causes an explosive effect. There are five primed types: Force, Necrotic, Fire, Cold, or Lightning,
which correspond with the following explosions:

Type | Explosion
--- | ---
Force | The primed target takes 2d6 force damage, is knocked back 6m and becomes prone.
Necrotic | The primed target takes 1d12 necrotic damage amd must pass a DC 13 Constituion saving throw or becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.
Fire | Each creature within a 4m radius, including the primed target, catch fire, taking 1d6 fire damage. Each creature continues to burn for 1 minute, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that is on fire can use its action put out the fire.
Cold | Each creature within a 4m radius, including the primed target, must pass a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save a creature is frozen until the end of its next turn.
Lightning | Each creature within a 4m radius, including the primed target, takes 3d4 lightning damage.

A creature can suffer from multiple primed types simultaneously as long as each type is different. When detonated, all
explosions happen at once centered on the location of the primed target.
