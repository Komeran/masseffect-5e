Create a negative mass effect field around a willing, Medium sized or smaller creature and lift it 2m into the air. The creature's speed becomes zero, but you can use a bonus action or reaction to move the creature up to 20m through the air. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target two additional creatures for each slot level above 3rd.
