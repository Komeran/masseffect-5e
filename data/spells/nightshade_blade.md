Your Omni-tool is equipped with a microscopic, poison-tipped blade that is able to piece through shields and armor. As an Attack action, make a ranged weapon attack on a creature you can see within range, you add your proficiency bonus to this roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 poison damage and must make on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus)). On a failed save, the target takes 2d12 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a target would be reduced to 0 hit points by this damage, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead and is {poisoned}. All damage caused by Nightshade Blade bypasses shields.
You must be within melee range and use an action to recover the blade.
This feature's secondary damage effect increases by 3d12 when you reach 5th level (5d12), 11th level (8d12), 17th level (11d12)
Infiltrators may learn or advance this feature instead of gaining a tech power.
