Rapidly altering the mass of air particles creates radioactive projectiles that seek out the targets and explode. Choose up to 4 creatures that you can see within range. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the end of your next turn and takes radiant damage equal to 6d12. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage, but suffers no other negative effect.
At higher levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, increase the damage by 2d12 for each spell slot above the 4th.
