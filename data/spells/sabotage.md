Spend 2 tech points and target a ranged weapon you can see within range. If the weapon is integrated into a creature, such as an Atlas mech's mass accelerator cannon or a drone's particle rifle, this spell has no effect unless the creature fails an Intelligence saving throw. The next attack made with the target weapon has disadvantage.
