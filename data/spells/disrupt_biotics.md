Spend 5 tech points to attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a biotic spell. Make an ability check using your tech ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level (0 for cantrips). On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
Each additional tech point spent reduces the DC by 1.
