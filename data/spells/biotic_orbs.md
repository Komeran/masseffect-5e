Summon 3 biotic orbs that float around you. If you have at least 3 orbs, you gain one additional max level (highest available level) spell slot. You may also expend an orb and make a ranged spell attack on a creature within 20m. On a hit, deal force damage equal to 2d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The orbs last 1 hour or until you've expended all of them.
At higher levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of level 3 or higher, the number of orbs increases by 2 for each slot level above the 2nd.
