Spend your action scanning a creature you can see with your omni-tool, studying its movement and revealing weaknesses. Your attacks against the target have advantage and natural 19 and 20's are considered critical hits. You may only have tactical scan on a single target.
You may use this ability three times before you finish a short or long rest.
