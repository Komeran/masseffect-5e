__Skill Proficiencies__. Insight, Performance

__Tool Proficiencies__. Disguise kit, one type of musical instrument

__Equipment__. A musical instrument, a set of fine clothes, and 5,000 credits

__Feature: Seducer's Wiles__. Your experiences with a variety of races have taught you how to use your tempting looks and inviting
attitude to bring anyone of either gender in your embrace. You can call upon a humanoid that can see and hear you and gain its attention
without it suspecting something (other than what you offer).

__Alternate Feature: Unrequited Love__. At some point in your service, a patron became obsessed with you, expressing his undying
love and vowing to protect you at all costs. Whenever you are in need, you can request this patron's aid. As long as you feign
reciprocal feelings they will fulfill your request to the best of their abilities, even to the point of sacrificing their life for you.
