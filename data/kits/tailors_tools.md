With access to your tools, you can perform one the following activities as part of a long rest. In the following
activities "armor" refers to light armor only.

__Create omni-gel__. Break down a piece of armor, gaining omni-gel equal to the amount listed on the
omni-gel rewards table.

__Install mod__. Install an armor mod into a piece of armor.

__Augment or repair armor__. Adjust a suit of armor to fit another race or repair a piece of
armor. Consumes 1 omni-gel.

__Craft armor__. Craft a single piece of armor (you must install mods after the armor has been crafted). Consumes 10 medi-gel
for head, legs, or arm armor, and 15 omni-gel for chest armor.
