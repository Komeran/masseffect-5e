### New Races!

We've got 2 new races, thanks to Ben McPherson!

#### Protheans
You'll want to work with your GM on playing a Prothean, as they were wiped out 50,000 years before the first Mass Effect game.
But Javik was discover in an undamaged stasis pod, so its possible there are other surviving members of the race throughout
the galaxy. As a prothean you have acces to a unique set of skills but they're not without the constant badgering of interested
parties wanting to know exactly _what_ you are.

#### Angara
If you've set your campaign in Andromeda, Angara a available as a playable race. We'll be working on incorporating more
Andromeda monsters and spells into the system, but this should give you enough to get started!

### New Character Sheet!

The feedback from users has called for the desperate need for an updated character sheet, and we're happy to deliver.
Veterans of 5th edition will not that the sheet might be a little unorthodox: AC on the back? ... Yes! When designing
this sheet we wanted to give a tactile action to starting an encounter. So when you roll for initiative, it means its time
to flip your sheet and use all the combat information on the back. It's not perfect, there are a lot of class features
that act as combat abilities, but this is out first draft. In future iterations we even hope to create class specific
character sheets.

### Other Changes

Other than that we've made some minor tweaks here and there. Some larger changes with Sentinel's tech armor. Review the
[changelog](/changelog) for the full list.
