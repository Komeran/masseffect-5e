Starting at {{ level }} level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal 
force damage to the target in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, 
plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. Biotic Slash detonates primed targets.
