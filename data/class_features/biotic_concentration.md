Starting at {{ level }} level, you can push your biotic implant to the limit. If you are already maintaining a concentration 
spell, you can cast another spell that requires concentration and maintain it. If you take damage you must make 2 Constitution 
saving throws to maintain the spells.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
