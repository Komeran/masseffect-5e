As an Action, spend 2 tech points to summon one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, disruption, recon, or rocket.
The stat blocks for the drones can be found in the [bestiary](/phb/bestiary)

You have complete control over the drone. Any hacking attempts on the drone are rolled against your intelligence, not the drone's. 

The drone has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.

The drone lasts 1 minute or until its hit points become 0 or lower.
