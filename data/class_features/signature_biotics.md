When you reach {{ level }} level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose 
two 2nd or 3rd-level biotic spells you know as your signature biotics. You can cast each of them once at 3rd level without 
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at 4th-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
