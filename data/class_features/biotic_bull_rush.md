Learn the Charge cantrip. If you have already learned the Charge cantrip, you may learn a new cantrip instead.

The distance of your Charge cantrip is now 14m.

When you use your action to cast the Charge cantrip, you may use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or shove 
the target creature. You gain +5 to the melee attackâ€™s damage roll, or shove the creature 6m.
