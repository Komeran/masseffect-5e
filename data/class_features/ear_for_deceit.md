You develop a keen ear for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to sense if a creature is lying, 
you use the total of your check or 8 + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you are proficient in Insight, you 
add your proficiency bonus to the fixed result. If you chose Insight as a skill augmented by your Expertise feature, add 
double your proficiency bonus.
