In addition to the standard defensive AI, you've augmented your Tech Armor to run different AI packages. The packages can 
hook into nearby armor systems. You and any friendly creature within 10m of you gain the effect of the
package. When you activate Tech Armor, you can only choose a single package to run.

Learn 2 AI packages from the list below (you've already learned the Defensive package).

Package | Effect

Defensive | This is the standard Tech Armor package. It does not affect allies.
Anti-biotic | Resistance to force and necrotic damage.
Anti-tech | Resistance to fire and cold damage.
Grounded | Resistance to lightning damage.
Reactive | At your spellcasting modifier to Strength or Dexterity saving throws.
Speed | Increase speed by 6m and can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.
