In addition to the standard defensive AI, you've augmented your Tech Armor to run different AI packages. The packages can 
hook into nearby armor systems. Any friendly creature within 10m of you that is wearing armor gains the effect of the 
package. When you activate Tech Armor, you can only choose a single package to run.

Learn 2 AI packages from the list below (you've already learned the Defensive package).

Package | Effect
--- | ---
Defensive | This is the standard Tech Armor package. It does not affect allies.
Anti-biotic | Resistance to force and necrotic damage.
Anti-tech | Resistance to fire and cold damage.
Grounded | Resistance to lightning damage.
Reactive | If you or a friendly creature wearing armor within range would make a saving throw, add your tech modifier to the roll.
Speed | Increase speed by 4m.
Regen | Friendly creatures wearing armor regenerate 5 shield points on the start of your turn.
