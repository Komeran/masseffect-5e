You gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As an action (or as a bonus action 
using Eye for Detail), you make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, 
opposed by the target's Charisma (Deception) check.  If you succeed, you can use Sneak Attack against that creature even 
if you do not have advantage against it or if no enemy of the target is within 2m of it. You can use Sneak Attack in 
this way even if you have disadvantage against the target. 

This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use Insightful Fighting against a different target.
