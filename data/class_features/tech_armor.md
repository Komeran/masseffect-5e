As a Sentinel, your mantra is the best offense is a good defense and coming back alive. Thus, you've bolstered your armor 
with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage, you can spend 1 TP to activate 
your Tech Armor.

When activated, tech armor creates a new kinetic barrier that has hit points equal to twice your Sentinel level + your Intelligence modifier.
Whenever you take damage, the tech armor takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces tech armor to 0 hit points, remaining damage is done
to your shields, then your hit points.

Tech armor lasts 1 minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. The number of times you can use Tech Armor between
long rests is equal to your proficiency bonus.
