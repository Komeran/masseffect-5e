As a Sentinel, your mantra is the best offense is a good defense and coming back alive. Thus, you've bolstered your armor 
with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage, you can spend 1 TP to activate 
your Tech Armor.

When activated, tech armor increases your AC by 2, you gain shield points equal to 1d8 + your Sentinel level, and you have 
resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. You can spend additional tech points to increase the shield point 
gain by 1d8 per tech point spent. At the start of each of your subsequent turns, Tech Armor consumes 1 tech point. If you 
have no tech points, Tech Armor ends and you lose all any shield points gained. You can use a bonus action to end Tech 
Armor early.

The number of times you can use Tech Armor between long rests is equal to your proficiency bonus.
