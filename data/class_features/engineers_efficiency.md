Starting at the {{ level }} level, you're able to optimize a basic tech power. Choose and learn one of the following 
tech powers: Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload. You may cast a 1 TP version of this power without expending any tech 
points. If you cast the power at a high level, you must spend all tech points as normal.

If you choose to advance the selected power, you may cast the advanced version using this feature.

The potency of this power increases by 1 tech point at the 7th (2TP version), 11th (3TP version), and 15th (4TP version) level.

If you wish to apply this feature to a power you've already learned, you may choose to learn or advance a different tech
power instead.
