At {{ level }} level, you may spend 5 TP to activate Tactical Cloak and teleport to a target within 10m, then make a melee 
attack. At the end of the attack (whether a miss or hit), activate Tactical Cloak again and teleport to another location 
up 10m away. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The teleportation can be used to free you from 
movement impairing effects such as grapple, restrained, lifted, etc.
