Starting at {{ level }} level, you can use your action and 1 tech point to overload your Tech Armor. Each creature within 4m must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the remaining hit points of your tech armor,
or half as much on a successful one.
