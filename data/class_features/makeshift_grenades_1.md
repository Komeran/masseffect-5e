Your omni-tool is so advanced, you can use tech points to create a specific grenade. Choose a grenade from the grenade 
list, it is permanently programmed into your Omni-tool.

As an action, you can spend 3 tech points to create and use a grenade of that type. You cannot replenish a grenade or 
gift a grenade with this ability.

You can spend 8 hours of programming to exchange your selected grenade with a different one.
