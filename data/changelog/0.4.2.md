Some minor rule changes and clean-up based on a play test 1/13/18

### Armor
The starting armor was very over powered, so 'standard' armor has been added for level 1 characters. In addition, some
armor set prices have been increased.

### Classes
The Extra Attack feature said it required a short rest between uses. This was a 'misprint'.

#### Soldier
* Weapon Master: Strafe moved to 7th level. Attack as a bonus action, not free action.
* Weapon Master: Quick reload changed to Devastating Critical, gained at 15th level.

#### Engineer
* Max Tech Point progression increased
* Drones last one minute. Clarification about attack bonuses made. AC differs per drone
* Medic: Healing drone's healing done increases like cantrips (in-line with all other drones), but you gain additional stats at 14th level.
* Drone Jockey: New feature Improved Drones.
* Drone Jockey: Feature progression rearranged: Dual Drones @ 7th level. Improved drones @ 10th level.

#### Infiltrator:
Sneak attack doesn't need advantage if target is flanked.

### Spells
* Barrier is an Action, with bonus action as available advancement. It was too easy to use all your Barrier Ticks for an attack,
then cast it as a bonus action at the end of your turn for defense. While we like this possibility, it shouldn't be available right
off the bat.
