Biotic "Higher Level" spell effects have been doubled. This was a major oversight in the way spell damage was handled. We
follow the DMG's recommendations for spell damage, but ME5e spells cap at 5th level. A 1st level spell in this
system is equivalent to a 1st or 2nd level in 5th Edition. 2nd => 3rd or 4th. Therefore, in this system, when you cast a
1st level spell as 2nd level, the spell is increased by 2 levels (not 1). Therefore the benefits should be doubled.

Additionally the range of most spell attacks has been increased.

* __Alter Center Mass__: Increased range
  * _Debilitate_: reduces speed and buffs AoE attacks on the target
* __Catapult__: Improved spell text.
  * _Salvo_: Max to number of targets
  * _Counterstrike_: Potential counterspell
* __Lance__: Increased Range.
  * _Anti-shield_ Lighting damage is in addition to force damage (not a replacement)
* __Nova__: Changed to a cantrip. Since it requires Barrier Ticks to cast, it did not make sense to add an additional resource cost.
  * _Half Blast_ adjusted for comparable damage to _Improved Damage_.
* __Pull__
  * _Control_ was removed and included in the spell. _Grip_ added to provided a damage-dealing component to the spell.
* __Reave__: Overhauled. Now reflects how the spell works in the Mass Effect games.
* __Shockwave__: Clarified the width of the line
  * _Improved Distance_ was removed and replaced with _Controlled Shockwave_, allowing the player to redirect the shockwave
  as it travels
