### Spells

__Backlash__
* Added the note that this applies to the triggering attack.
* Changed the wording to allow this to block damage from ranged spell attacks (not just weapon attacks)
* Added note that reflecting damage cannot be triggered by a heavy weapon (they're technically ranged attacks)
* Reduced the higher level hp increase to 10 instead of 20. At +20 hp, a 5th level cast was 75 additional hp...seemed a
bit much. This also brings the spell in line with 5th's Armor of Agathys.
* In the same vein, removed the additional hp at higher level casts from Durable advancement. Total hp gain on durable
is now 60 instead of 75.
* Clarified the issue with remaining damage and reflecting damage back at the attacker with "If damage that would be dealt
to the aegis...". RAW would be: Aegis has 1HP remaining. Player is hit with a ranged weapon attack for 10 damage. First,
split the damage (5 and 5). 5 is dealt back at the attack. 1 is dealt to the aegis. 4 is dealt to the player.
