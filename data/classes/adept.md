spellcastingText: >
  Adepts have an L5x biotic implant which requires conscious control over their nervous system. As an
  Adept, you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
  your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an
  attack roll with one.
