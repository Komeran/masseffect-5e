## v0.6.0

### General
* Removed "Backgrounds" page. Information was incomplete and not applicable. Will be re-introduced when backgrounds are complete.

### Classes
Starting weapon choices adjusted:
* M-8 Avenger replaces M-96 Mattock
* M-4 Shuriken replaces M-25 Hornet
* M-92 Mantis replaces M-13 Raptor

#### Adepts
* Adepts learn 2 cantrips and 2 1st level spells at level 1. This makes up for the fact that Adepts do not gain any basic ability at level 1.
I.e., Engineers = Drone; Infiltrators = Tactical Cloak, Sentinel = Tech Armor, etc.
* Additional opportunities to learn biotic spells. Total opportunities = 16.

#### Engineers
* Engineer's Efficiency added at level 3, providing the engineer with a cantrip-like tech power.
* Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers. Total opportunities = 14

#### Infiltrators
* Tech power acquisition redistributed, allowing 9 opportunities to learn or advance tech powers (used to be 6).
* Tech point maximum increased to end at max 8, instead of max 6.

#### Sentinels
Overall, Sentinels were reworked to provide more opportunities to __learn__ biotic spells and tech powers, but they can never
cast those spells with the potency of Engineers or Adepts. This change also balances potential multi-classing. I.e., a multi-classed
Adept/Engineer could have 8 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 10 Biotic spells (max spell slot 3rd level). Whereas a max level Sentinel
could have 7 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 8 Biotic Spells (max spell slot 3rd level).

#### Vanguards
* Removed the automatic acquisition of Barrier at level 1. Instead, Vanguards can choose one of the following cantrips: Charge, Biotic Punch, Barrier, or Throw

* Removed Sentinel Mastery class feature, replaced with additional opportunity to learn a biotic spell and tech power.
* Increased the level at which Sentinels can learn biotic spells: 5th level = 1st level spells, 9th level = 2nd level spells, 15th level = 3rd level spells.
* Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers and biotic spells. Total opportunities = 15

### Weapons

* Melee weapon attack damage bypasses shields.
* Krogan Warhammer no longer stuns or pushes enemy back. Instead, has the possibility to knock the target prone.
* M-8 Avenger: RoF reduced to 3
* M-96 Mattock: Damage increased to d10
* M-4 Shuriken: Damage reduced to d1
* M-25 Hornet: Range increased to 8m
