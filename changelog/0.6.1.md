Drone Jockeys completely refactored. Though the multi-drone approach was fun, it significantly slowed down combat and proved rather powerful at all levels.
Instead Drone Jockeys function almost identically to 5th Edition's Beast Conclave. You'll get to create a Drone Companion that persists outside of combat,
gains valuable stat and defensive increases, and has its own personality.

Additionally, Drones are now a stat block in the bestiary. As such, the Drone ability will summon the bestiary version. Medics
are still the only subclass that can access the Repair (Healing) drone.
