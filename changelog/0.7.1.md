### Rules

### Weapons
* There was an error in the cost calculation formula making the weapon costs too high.
* __Black Widow__; was missing its additional benefits (ignores half cover, 1d4 additional damage to targets not behind cover)
* __Hip Fire__: Removed the advantage that hip-fire provided on targets within 2m. This was an unfair benefit over melee weapons.

### Races
* Salarian's photographic memory offered expertise in skills that are no longer in the game.

### Classes
* Removed Stun Baton from starting weapon options (it is an uncommon weapon). Replaced with Omni-Torch for Engineers.
