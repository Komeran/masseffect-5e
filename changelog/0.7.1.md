### General
* Monsters and NPCs that used grenades now have a Recharge 5-6 for grenades, rather than a set number of grenades. The recharge
is not meant to indicate that the NPC is literally regenerating a grenade over time, but a random chance that the PC has more grenades.

### Weapons
* There was an error in the cost calculation formula making the weapon costs too high.
* __Black Widow__; was missing its additional benefits (ignores half cover, 1d4 additional damage to targets not behind cover)
* __Hip Fire__: Removed the advantage that hip-fire provided on targets within 2m. This was an unfair benefit over melee weapons.
* __Shotguns__: Reduced long range to double normal range instead of triple.
* __SMGs__: Hip fire added to most SMGs

### Races
* Salarian's photographic memory offered expertise in skills that are no longer in the game.

### Classes
* Removed Stun Baton from starting weapon options (it is an uncommon weapon). Replaced with Omni-Torch for Engineers.
* Increase range of Tech Aura (__Guardian Sentinel__) from 4m/10m => 10m/20m

### Bestiary
* __Rocket Drone__: now has a range for it's distortion rockets
