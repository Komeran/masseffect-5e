### Weapons
* There was an error in the cost calculation formula making the weapon costs too high. This primarily affected common weapons.
* Black Widow was missing its additional benefits (ignores half cover, 1d4 additional damage to targets not behind cover)

### Races
* Salarian's photographic memory offered expertise in skills that are no longer in the game.

### Classes
* Removed Stun Baton from starting weapon options (it is an uncommon weapon). Replaced with Omni-Torch for Engineers.
