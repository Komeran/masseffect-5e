### General
#### Burst Fire
We've introduced a new weapon feature that borrows from the Dungeon Master's Guide, _Burst Fire_. Weapons with Burst Fire allow players to spend their action
"spraying and praying" giving a bit more variety to assault rifles and smgs.

#### Fighting styles
The advanced versions of fighting styles have been removed. Trying to balance advanced fighting styles proved difficult,
and many advanced versions we're too powerful. In addition, some fighting styles have been updated:
* Gunslinger: Effectively grants Two-Weapon fighting for ranged weapons. Though it can no longer stack with Double Tap, there is no damage penalty on the attack
made with your bonus action.
* The Freehand: Description clarified to provide bonus when wielding a weapon that is not two-handed
* Carnage: Replaced with damage reroll (similar to 5th Edition's Great Weapon Fighter).
* _(New)_ Close Quarters Shooter: Slightly less powerful version of 5th editions, the limitations are put in place because the majority of combat is ranged and the
benefit of the 5th edition version out-shined all other offensive fighting styles
* _(New)_ Assault: Increases your Burst Fire capability
