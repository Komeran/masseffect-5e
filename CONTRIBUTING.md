For the code savvy, you can always fork the repo, make changes and issue pull requests. Otherwise:

Otherwise, the standard for contributing ideas, improvements, site bugs, etc. is as follows:

1. You'll need a GitHub account
2. In the repo, click the Issues tab. Here you'll find a list of past and present issues. 

We define issues as anything ranging from a typo to a whole new addition to the system, such as a Race concept. However, before 
opening a new issue, we only ask that you do a cusory seach of existing issues to see if the idea, bug, etc. already has been reported.

In the list of issues we use labels to designate the status:

#### Site specific labels
You can still comment on these, but they're not in the scope of theory crafting for the system.

`site enhancement` refers to a possible improvement to the website or webapp. For example, "add filters for weapon type"
`site bug` refers to a problem with the site. This might be a broken link or a typo. 

#### Theory crafting, ideas, additions, and more
The bulk of the discussion for upcoming changes will be labeled with:

`discussion open` everyone is open comment and provide additional input.

However:

`discussion closed` means that we've either reached consensus (or made a final decision) and the change will be added in the next release milestone. 
It could still take a few days or a weeks to get onto the site, depending on how involved the change is.

#### Contextual labels

`duplicate` means the issue has a duplicate somewhere else. The duplicate will be reference and the issue will be closed. 

`wontfix` means the discussion is closed but no change is needed.

`completed for next release` is the label we use for changes that have been completed on the backend but haven't yet been published.
You should only see this label on `site enhancement` or `discussion complete`.
