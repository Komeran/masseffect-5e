        Armor Customization is a new feature and provides a lot of the options that would be handled by Magical Items in traditional 5e.
        It costs a pretty penny, so creating armor might not be available to new characters, but as they progress, you should be able
        to afford custom jobs.

        When you create a piece of armor from scratch, you need to select:
      ol.pl-3
        li The armor placement (Head, Chest, Arms, Legs).
        li If you want to add additional mod slots.
        li If you need to customize the armor to fit your race.

      p.
        You can sometimes apply custom mods, additional mod slots, and race customizations to armor you've looted from the battlefield. The same prices apply.
        If the awarded armor is a manufactured Armor Set, it cannot be customized.
      v-alert(type="info" v-bind:value="true").
        #[strong GM Note]: When awarding Armor, be sure to say the number of mod slots it came with or if it cannot be customized (i.e., an Armor Set).
        Only premium quality armor would have more than the starting amount in the table above. For really cheap armor, you can remove mod slots completely.
