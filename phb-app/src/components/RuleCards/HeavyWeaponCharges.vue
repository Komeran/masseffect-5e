      p.
        If you've got your hands on a heavy weapon, you're either a military specialist or damn lucky you survived the
        battle. It's not easy resupplying your charges. You've either got to have some serious military or black market connections.
        If military, you might get special permission to keep the weapon and granted a steady stream of charges (once per long rest).
        That's between you and your GM.
      p.
        Otherwise, you'll have to pay a pretty penny on the black market to recharge your Heavy Weapon (around 20,000 credits for a
        complete resupply of charges). In most cases, it's easier to scavenge or steal ammo. Or simply leave the damn thing were
        you found it.
