      p.
        Melee weapons have the same attributes as D&D 5e weapons, i.e. finesse, light, thrown, etc. But melee weapons do have a strength
        requirement. If your STR attribute is less than the requirement, all attacks made with the weapon are made with disadvantage.
        This requirement is denoted in parentheses in the "STR Req" column of the handbook.
      p.
        In addition to wielding a melee weapon, each class has an Omnni-Tool attack. This is considered a melee attack.
