This makes up for the fact that Adepts do not gain any basic ability at level 1.\nI.e., Engineers = Drone; Infiltrators = Tactical Cloak, Sentinel = Tech Armor, etc.</li>\n<li>Additional opportunities to learn biotic spells. Total opportunities = 16.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Engineers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineer's Efficiency added at level 3, providing the engineer with a cantrip-like tech power.</li>\n<li>Additional opportunities to learn a tech powers. Total opportunities = 14</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Infiltrators</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tech power acquisition redistributed, allowing 9 opportunities to learn or advance tech powers (used to be 6).</li>\n<li>Tech point maximum increased to end at max 8, instead of max 6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Sentinels</h4>\n<p>Overall, Sentinels were reworked to provide more opportunities to <strong>learn</strong> biotic spells and tech powers, but they can never\ncast those spells with the potency of Engineers or Adepts. This change also balances potential multi-classing. I.e., a multi-classed\nAdept/Engineer could have 8 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 10 Biotic spells (max spell slot 3rd level). Whereas a max level Sentinel\ncould have 7 Tech Powers (max TP = 6) and 8 Biotic Spells (max spell slot 3rd level).</p>\n<h4>Vanguards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the automatic acquisition of Barrier at level 1.

Before, site stated that Ability Score Improvements could be substituted for a feat &quot;available to your race&quot;.\nFeat acquisition is only limited during character creation for level 1 characters. Otherwise, all feats are available to all races.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added normal and long range distance to ranged weapons. Essentially, this added a limit to which weapons cannot be fired beyond.</li>\n<li>Melee weapon attack damage bypasses shields.</li>\n<li>Krogan Warhammer no longer stuns or pushes enemy back. Instead, has the possibility to knock the target prone.</li>\n<li>M-8 Avenger: RoF reduced to 3</li>\n<li>M-96 Mattock: Damage increased to d10</li>\n<li>M-4 Shuriken: Damage reduced to d1</li>\n<li>M-25 Hornet: Range increased to 8m</li>\n<li>M-13 Raptor: Damage increased to d8</li>\n<li>All Heavy Weapons are unique (cannot be modded)</li>\n<li>Double Tap allows Dex mod to be used when making the attack roll (not damage roll). Used to prevent dex mod from being applied to attack and damage roll. This bring the skill in line\nwith 5th Edition's Two-Weapon Fighting rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase potency cost of <code>+1 to melee, ranged, biotic, tech, or combat</code> attack and damage rolls from 8000/level to 12000/level.
