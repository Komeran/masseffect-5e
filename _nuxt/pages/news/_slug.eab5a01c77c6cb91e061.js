There aren't any new monsters,\na planned Drone Jockey overhaul was left to the wayside, and some spell changes didn't make it in. The reason is that\nI've spent the majority of my time working on a major overhaul of the back-end of the site.</p>\n<p>Prior to this release there were some major hurdles I was battling with. For one, the Player's Handbook (PHB) and the information pages (index, about, news), were split\nbetween 2 systems (Vue and Jekyll). I'd also been 'hacking' my development setup which often caused errors which led to hours debugging.\nAdditionally, the setup had a fatal flaw in that permalinked urls to the player's handbook would render blank pages, which\nmeant site crawlers weren't able to parse any information in the PHB pages. I'm not too concerned about Search Engine Optimization (SEO), but felt that\ncrawlers should at least be able to scan the bulk of the content.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted a bit more pizazz and clarification on the homepage to explain what this system was and how to get started. My\nanalytics were showing a pretty high bounce rate (lower is better) on the homepage, but a high acquisition rate for users that\nmanaged to make it to the Player's Handbook. I.e., users would land on the site, see only news and the logo and think, &quot;We'll this looks\npretty lame, bye!&quot;</p>\n<p>What was initially a piecemeal approach to fixing these issues turned into a complete overhaul, which took much longer than I originally anticipated.</p>\n<h3>The Good News</h3>\n<h4>1. Fancy new site pages</h4>\n<p>I probably enjoy this more than most. But the homepage, about section, and news section all have new styles.</p>\n<h4>2. Increased interest in the system</h4>\n<p>Over the past 2 weeks, I've received a swarm of feedback. At least 7 people have mentioned they're getting ready to start a campaign.\nThis has me floored. Before, I knew of only a few groups who were actively using the system. Not it seems like we're up to about a dozen.\nThe more users we have the more feedback and play testing we'll get, which will really help the system evolve.</p>\n<p>On this note, I need to give some shoutouts to Ben McPherson, Noel Moriarty, Adam (TheMarmotKing), and Alex Needleman who've been working really hard on pointing out\nsite bugs, over/underpowered mechanics, and creating new content. Keep up the good work everyone!</p>\n<h4>3. Still get some new changes</h4>\n<p>Even though my time was limited, I was still able to push a host of new changes, but this is mainly thanks to the aforementioned people.</p>\n<p>The major addition is that Weapon Mods were added. These will give players a new way to get bonuses on weapons which helps alleviate the lack of\n+N magical items that 5th edition has. Another big change was the increase opportunities for classes to learn Tech and Biotic powers, which should\nhelp make the classes feel less stale between levels. There are a host of other changes, all of which can be read about in the <a href=\"/changelog\">changelog</a>.</p>\n</section>\n"},IAN2:function(e,t){e.exports="<section><h3>Many hands</h3>\n<p>First, we want to give a thanks to following people.

But\nwe consider this version to bring a much better balance to the weapon system, despite the slightly reduced damage overall.</p>\n<p>We noticed quite a few problems with the previous versions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Weapons dealt 15-20% more damage than in 5th Edition</li>\n<li>The spread of damage was huge 1d4 =&gt; 4d10</li>\n<li>The Rate of Fire mechanic didn't have any benefits other than being flavor about the weapon. And even the flavor was difficult to apply.\nTake the M-4 Shuriken: in the game, this weapon specifically has a six-round burst, meaning 6 RoF. But since it's meant to be a starting weapon, we had to make it deal 6d1. There are other cases where RoF didn't directly correlate.</li>\n<li>Weapon damage was unbalanced. We received a lot of feedback that Shotguns were too powerful, Sniper rifles underpowered, and melee weapons worthless.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our solution was to create weapon profiles and build from those profiles. In doing so we also created distinct levels for\nthe weapons that mirror 5th edition's item rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare). This provided a system in which we could\nmake objectively better weapons, whereas previous versions attempted to make all weapons unique (save for the starting weapons).</p>\n<p>We're very pleased with the result and feel the weapons are more balanced than they've ever been. If you'd like to read the entire\ndiscussion, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/249\">github issue</a>. Additionally, we prepared\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSq70x_GZuDKcELgX8k_7Hd6nLGu3DoIEdDwP-YEGjUU-ghGc7ot_Q7140FZwGbEalHgzPwVm4BN8y_/pubhtml?gid=332103674&amp;single=true\">an analysis</a> of the new weapon balance.</p>\n<h4>Mods</h4>\n<p>In the last release, we introduced weapon mods, but this was rushed and not thoroughly tested. It became clear that the stacking of certain mods\n(especially between weapons an armor) created very high bonuses. In 5th edition, +X items are limited to +4 for legendary type items, but our\nmod combinations could result in as much as +7. In response, we've changed or removed any armor mods or sets that increased the effectiveness of\nranged weapons. Basically, let weapon mods buff weapons and let armor mods buff defenses. The only caveat is that armor can still provide boosts\nto melee weapons, as they currently have no mods.</p>\n<h4>Drone Jockeys</h4>\n<p>As alluded to in our previous release, we've been working on an overhaul of the Drone Jockey (Engineer) subclass and it's finally here.\nNow you can have a permanent drone companion, outfitted with its rudimentary AI (yeah, it's going have personality traits). This also changes the Drone\nclass feature as well. Drones now have their own stat block in the Bestiary, and when you summon one, you summon the bestiary version.</p>\n<h4>Race Changes</h4>\n<p>Primarily due to work of the contributors listed above, we audited each race. We focused on missing lore specific traits,\nbalancing the traits between races, and clarifying trait mechanics. Of particular note, Asari will use Charisma as their\nspellcasting modifier for biotic spells, rather than Wisdom.</p>\n<h4>Other changes</h4>\n<p>There are a host of other changes in this release, but too many to highlight. The <a href=\"/changelog\">changelog</a> has all the details.</p>\n<h3>What's next?</h3>\n<p>We've got a lot of things in the works!</p>\n<h4>Angara Race</h4>\n<p>Ben (bcmcpherson), our local Andromeda expert has been creating a lot of Andromeda content. Most notably is his <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues/205\">Angara concept</a>.\nWe're not quite ready to include everything in the system because we need to do a bit of housekeeping on the backend. But, we encourage you to test\nout the race and provide feedback!</p>\n<h4>Digital Character Sheet</h4>\n<p>Ben has also been working on a version of the Character Sheet in Google Sheets. Once the finishing touches are ready, we'll get it up on the site.</p>\n<h4>Loot Generator</h4>\n<p>As the dust settles on the cost of mods, weapons, and armor, we've been working on a Loot Generator and guidelines for awarding credits. That should be out in the very near future.</p>\n</section>\n"},JxWv:function(e,t){e.exports="<section><p>For the past month, I've been quietly working on the bestiary. For people who've read the DMG or used it to create monsters,\nyou'll know it can be a complicated process. That's not a complaint. I love the details and thoroughness provided by WoC.\nBut it means that creating really good monsters takes time.</p>\n<p>My initial tentative list included a lot of archetypes. Not simply an archetype for each class, but archetypes that could span Challenge Rating (CR),\nraces, classes, etc. But while working on the archetypes, I was repeating a ton of work. The silver lining was that I\nrealized many of these archetypes could be 1) programmatically created and 2) randomized.</p>\n<p>This led me to designing a utility that could generate archetypes with random stats, features, and actions. I call it\nthe &quot;Grunt Generator.&quot; No, this isn't a <em>Home Improvement</em> reference. A &quot;grunt&quot; is a throwaway NPC. It's not as specific\nor unique as a monster, but it doesn't have the time and effort of a reoccurring or important NPC (like a boss or rival team).\nUsing the monster creation logic in the DMG, I created a very complex, programmatic &quot;flowchart.&quot; It adjusts\nattack bonus, defensive bonuses, and damage per round based on the chosen CR level. This ensures that the generated grunts aren't too powerful or too weak.</p>\n<p>Another benefit this utility brings is variety. With Wizard's Monster Manual, Volo's Guide, and the plethora of other books in existence,\nthere are hundreds if not thousands of monsters to choose from. I could spend years working on Mass Effect monsters and not come close\nto the amount provided in D&amp;D. So I took a short cut. The randomized stats, class, race, features, spells, tech\nand weapons means the number of unique grunts totals in the tens of thousands!</p>\n<p>Finally, a hidden benefit I hadn't planned for was loot. Because the weapons that a grunt has equipped are\nrandomized, when players take out a grunt, they can loot the body. This makes it really easy to pass out new weapon options\nto your players. Armor isn't a part of the grunt generator (yet?), so you'll still need to decided if there is any armor to\nloot. But at least the weapons are easy!</p>\n<p>In the Player's Handbook, you'll find a new section, &quot;GM Tools&quot;. In the future, I hope to fill this with other utilities,\nbut for now you can use the Grunt Generator. Pick you target CR, class, and race get generating! You can save the generated\ngrunt and make a list for your encounters. I'm eventually going to turn the list into a true encounter\nutility, which will let you pull in monsters from the bestiary. I've also got plans to improve the Grunt Generator,\nlike advanced options to let you tailor you grunts a bit more.</p>\n<p>Please note, I'm still working on the bestiary. Hopefully this new feature will keep your campaigns active and fun until\nI can get an official bestiary up. And don't be afraid to use monsters available in D&amp;D, this is a large universe!</p>\n</section>\n"},MvNw:function(e,t){e.exports="<section><h2>Shields</h2>\n<p>Something that's been nagging me for some time is the shield mechanic. The idea was this: shields make up half of a\nplayer's health and slowly regenerate if they don't take damage. Sounds great, right? But a simple, great sounding idea\ncan get complicated quickly. The first major hurdle was divvying up player health. Trying to 'split dice' resulted in\na total health pool about 10% higher than in 5th edition. When I factored in the average rate of shield\nregen the increase jumped to more than 25% higher.</p>\n<p>More importantly, rolling each turn to get shields back wasn't very exciting and took up a lot of time. Each round of\ncombat, players had to think: <em>did I take damage? I didn't...</em> [rolls dice] <em>...oh, goody, 2 sp I need track</em>. I found\nthat players actively choose <em>not</em> to roll because they didn't really care for the benefit.</p>\n<p>The final problem was the mechanic didn't fit the fiction. What happens when a player removes their armor? Do they still have shields?\nWhat is the underlying effect that causes you to gain more shields when you level up?</p>\n<p>Through discussions with Swampson, we cam up with an alternative that we believe fixes all of these problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shields no longer level up with the character.</li>\n<li>Shields are a small regenerating pool of temporary hp.</li>\n<li>Shields come standard in all chest armor pieces, with a base of 5 shield points and a regen of 5. Both can be increased with mods.</li>\n<li>Shields only recharge an amount equal to their regen when the character takes the Hide or Dodge action and then takes no damage until the start of their next turn.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#1 &amp; #2 fix the health and fiction issues. But I'm especially excited about #3. The idea of hiding or dodging to recharge\nyour shields is a great reflection of Mass Effect combat. Plus, the reward has more potential for the player. Although, 5 additional\nhit points doesn't sound like a lot, it is for a level 1 character wearing standard armor, and as players level up they can\nget upwards of 30-40 shield points via upgrading their armor. What I really enjoy is that players now have an\nactive choice in regaining shields, but there is still some luck involved.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, I'm also a fan of how well this mechanic blends with the existing 5th edition rules. Instead of a more\ncomplex set of hp, shields are akin to a cantrip that provides temporary hp. The increase in health isn't too much to break\nthe system, but enough to help mitigate the lack of healing spells.</p>\n<p>If you've got any thoughts on this change, feel free to use the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1\">feedback form</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bestiary</h2>\n<p>As mentioned in my previous post, I've still be working on the bestiary. My goal is 100 unique monsters and npcs by the end\nof April (no promises!). For now, I am happy to be able to give you the Reaper and Collector forces. Before you get too excited,\nno, this does not include a Reaper. That's a task that will take extensive play testing. But, with the random grunt generator,\nI hope this is enough to get you started on a fun campaign. From here on out, instead of a huge drop in April, I'll add\nfactions as I complete them. Cerberus is next, followed by the Geth, then the mercenary factions (Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack).\nFinishing out the bestiary with some aliens, re-skined 5th edition monsters that I think fit well into the universe, and some\nnamed NPCS. When I finally do drop a Reaper stat block into the mix, I'm sure I'll have a very long post explaining my choices,\nmath, and play testing notes.</p>\n<h2>Site improvements</h2>\n<p>Probably least exciting to the average user (but exciting for me) are the minor site enhancements I've added.\nSpells, weapons, monsters, and grunts can now be bookmarked for quick reference. Conditions and some rule references\nnow have tooltips. And we've added spell cards to the [Printables]({{ site.github.url }}/printables) section. Special\nthanks to Swampson for banging those out.

I started using\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTyqV8mnMFzRexQ_pEMnX1-BFRqFt3Jb_uCBjjY3nUdPCMbNT0dXc7Nkd4tIlZlzjv4NuR6xB44Euqd/pubhtml\">spreadsheets</a>\nto track damage progression throughout levels. FYI - Those sheets are sorely\nout of date, as I threw in a plethora of changes last minute. But that's the documentation\nfor how the new classes stack up damage wise. It's really just proof that\nI put in <em>some</em> amount of time trying to balance this system out.</p>\n<p>The other major issue is that I wanted this conversion to reflect D&amp;D 5th Edition\nas much as it could. I'd spent too much time coming up with random abilities and class features\nrather than leaning back on the amazing work WoC does. So, in this iteration, I focused\non taking subclass features from 5e and sticking them in at appropriate levels. There is\nstill plenty of homebrew content, but the classes should have a much more familiar feel than before.</p>\n<h2>Player's Handbook</h2>\n<p>To keep things more sustainable, I've completely rewritten the [player's handbook]({{ site.github.url }}/phb/) into a single page webapp. This\npart of the site will now exist to keep people updated on news, play testing, and other miscellaneous items, like printable character sheets\nand spell cards.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you see any spelling errors or come across any bugs, please <a href=\"https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/issues\">add an issue in the repo</a></p>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<h3>Rules</h3>\n<p>Mostly clarifications with a few minor updates.</p>\n<h4>Weapons</h4>\n<p><strong>Weapon Handling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reloading takes an action</li>\n<li>Holstering and drawing a new weapon is a bonus action</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weapon Stats</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Made the <strong>Rof &amp; Heat</strong> stat simpler. Instead of subtracting RoF from Heat, heat is now the number of times you\ncan fire the weapon before you need to reload.</li>\n<li><strong>Rare</strong> Weapons. Basically a way of saying lvl 1 PCs shouldn't have access to these weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weapon Attributes</strong>\nWeapons now have different types of attributes like &quot;Arc&quot; and &quot;Hip Fire&quot; which give the weapon additional combat perks.</p>\n<p><strong>Removed Hip Fire</strong>\nThe previous version gave all weapons advantage in melee range. Now only Hip Fire weapons have advantage in melee range.\nThe standard D&amp;D rule applies that all other ranged weapons have disadvantage in melee range.</p>\n<h4>Armor</h4>\n<p>Expanded the Armor section. Currently working on pre-made armor sets and armor mods.</p>\n<h4>Consumables</h4>\n<p>It never felt &quot;right&quot; that grenades and ammo powers were &quot;spells&quot;. So I've made them consumables. Consumables\nare kind of like magic items. They have an associated rarity (how often you'll get access to them) and are gone\nonce you use them.</p>\n<p><strong>Medi-gel</strong>\n...has been added. Lets you use a hit die in combat. See Rules &gt; Consumables in the PHB.</p>\n<h4>Skills</h4>\n<p>New Skills: <strong>Engineering</strong>, <strong>Xenology</strong></p>\n<h3>Races</h3>\n<p><strong>Geth</strong>\nI took away a few of the Tech powers that came from geth classes in ME3 Multiplayer mode and made them geth only.\nRepair Matrix and Hunter Mode didn't really make sense for organic creatures. In addition, geth get some really nice\nclass-specific features at level 11. This is to make up for the fact that geth cannot take any feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Quarians</strong>\nRemoved Improvised Grenade and added Cybernetic Augmentation. Read about the latter in the codex and felt the Imp grenade was\nlame.</p>\n<p><strong>Salarains</strong>\nMade Photographic Memory much more powerful, cosidering this is one of the weakest races. Great for Skill Monkeys though!</p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>To be honest, so much has changed with the classes, the best I can do is give you an overview of each one. I'm also providing\na % done. By this, I mean how much the class <strong>feels</strong> complete, which should also be an indication of how much it's likely to change\nin the future.</p>\n<h4>General</h4>\n<p><strong>Damage!</strong></p>\n<p>A major issue in the previous iteration was that every class's damage output stopped scaling around level 10. This\nhas been fixed. It also meant implementing a new Max TP system for Engineers, Infiltrators, and Sentinels. Basically, as you\nlevel, you can spend more TP on your Tech Powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Powers</strong></p>\n<p>I added in Combat Powers, which are mechanically like class features (generally only use them once per short/long rest),\nbut give you the customizing feel of spells and tech powers, i.e., you can choose which ones you want. Soldiers choose\nCombat powers as they progress, but Infiltrators can take a few as well instead of learning a tech power. I hope to expand\nthe crossover list further.</p>\n<h4>Adepts</h4>\n<p><strong>90%</strong>\nBrought adepts much more in line with Wizards, borrowing a lot of class and subclass features from D&amp;D.</p>\n<h4>Engineers</h4>\n<p><strong>90%</strong>\nPrimarily worked on the Support subclass, giving it more variety.</p>\n<h4>Infiltrators</h4>\n<p><strong>75%</strong>\nRedistributed and added more of the Rogue features from D&amp;D. Still feels like it could use a little bit more work.</p>\n<h4>Sentinels</h4>\n<p><strong>60%</strong>\nI feel like tech armor changes every time I sit down to do edits. I need to do a lot more playtesting with Sentinels and\nall subclasses before I can put a button in it.</p>\n<h4>Soldiers</h4>\n<p><strong>85%</strong>\nProbably the most drastic overhaul, getting rid of adrenaline dice, reworking the subclasses, adding combat powers,\nand making them progress more like fighters. I'm mostly happy with the outcome.</p>\n<h4>Vanguards</h4>\n<p><strong>75%</strong>\nUpdated subclasses and tried to make them more melee heavy. A mix of Paladins, Barbarians, and Fighters. Could still use\nsome work.</p>\n<h3>Feats</h3>\n<p>Added a new Feat: Grenadier. Hoping to add a few more in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>SleightxHope provided all of these. Will try to add more soon.</p>\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n<p>Also major overhauls.</p>\n<p>Well, I think that's everything. This has been a hell of sprint to get all the edits in, but I think it's at a much more stable\nplace where we can slow add new feature and adjust classes.

I'm deputizing him at the official &quot;Copy Editor&quot; of this project, whether he likes it or not.</p>\n<h2>Spell changes</h2>\n<p>The major changes to be aware of is the increase to biotic spell damage. I goofed in my previous version and WAY\nundercut the power of the spells. Now the average spell damage should align to the following: <strong>Level</strong>,<code>Single Target Dmg</code>,<code>AoE Dmg</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cantrip</strong>: <code>5.5</code>, <code>3.5</code></li>\n<li><strong>1st-lvl</strong>: <code>13.5</code>, <code>10.5</code></li>\n<li><strong>2nd-lvl</strong>: <code>30</code>, <code>22.5</code></li>\n<li><strong>3rd-lvl</strong>: <code>49.5</code>, <code>33</code></li>\n<li><strong>4th-lvl</strong>: <code>63</code>, <code>43.5</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason for the changes, is that a 4th level spell is effectively an 7th/8th level spell in 5th edition.</p>\n<h2>Armor Sets</h2>\n<p>A big addition in 0.4.0 is the pre-made Armor Sets. They're cheaper than creating custom armor, but lack the ability to be customized.</p>\n<h2>Starting equipment</h2>\n<p>Due to the addition to the armor sets, each race also has a starting weapon and armor. Each race has the option of rolling for credits to buy their own equipment.\nEvery die count/die type combination averages to about 25,000 credits. But based on lifespan, you may get roll more or less die.\nThe reasoning is that long-lived (asari, krogan) races have a higher chance to be average in their monetary gains . Whereas, short-lived\nraces (salarians, vorcha) have a higher probability of either being in their peak or low of their monetary gains. Since it's just\na starting roll, it shouldn't effect gameplay too much. It was a nice way to factor in that flavor. The only exceptions are Volus, who only start with money\nand Geth/Unshackled AI, who effectively don't need to purchase armor, so start with less.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mod Overhaul</h2>\n<p>I've finally rounded out and standardized the the available armor mods. In addition, there are also detailed instructions\nfor creating armor mods in the armor rules section. So feel free to create your own!</p>\n<h2>Feedback form</h2>\n<p>And finally, I've added a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1\">Google Form</a> so anyone can provide feedback without having to make a Github account.</p>\n<p>As always, be sure to review the <a href=\"/changelog\">changelog</a> for all\nthe changes.

It may seem like 3 weeks is\na long time to only have finished 12 monsters, but I need to refactor the underlying weapon code. Originally, I was creating\nduplicate attacks for each weapon. I.e., there was an NPC weapon attack and the weapon itself. But this was creating a lot\nof inconsistent data and needed to be remedied.</p>\n<p>Except for the delay, I am happy with the diversity among this group of NPCs. Adjutants add a bit of 'vampire'-flare to the system.\nPhantoms and Dragoons are a threat up close and hard to hit. Combat Engineers can be troublesome by spawning Turrets. Guardians\nare walking tanks that can take a serious amount of damage. All the while, a Nemesis might be taking pot-shots at you from 80m out.</p>\n<h2>Re-aligning with 5e</h2>\n<p>Re-aligning Mass Effect 5th Edition (ME5e) with 5th Edition (5e), where possible, is an on-going process.\nThe first few versions of ME5e were based on cool ideas and not thoroughly play tested. As ME5e evolves, we want to be sure\nit has a balance and doesn't drift too far from the source. In some cases, the drift is necessary, a plethora of weapons and a nod towards\nscience over arcane. In other cases, the drift is intentional to add depth and variety: the expanded armor rules. But in a lot of cases,\nthe drift makes playing ME5e more complicated than intended. We want to fall back on existing 5e rules and only make changes\nwhere the core rules don't have the necessary structures to support this setting. A few examples follow.</p>\n<h3>Omni-tool attacks</h3>\n<p>In v0.5.0, we removed omni-tool attacks. This is a case where I'd simply pulled the idea straight out of ME3, in which each\nclass has its own attack. Though I've received feedback that it was a fun idea, the effect was that each class's default melee\naction was set and not a choice the player can make. However, we still need to replace the ME idea of having an omni-tool attack.\nNothing feels better than picking off a few marauders at range while a group of husks close in on you and, at the last second,\nspawning a blade and cutting those zombies to shreds.</p>\n<p>I never intended to lose this feeling, but I hadn't created the structures to replace it. In v0.5.1, we're halfway there.\nWe've introduced multiple types of Omni-weapons which have the potential to work like the previous omni-tool attacks. First,\nthese weapons don't use a weapon slot (and have a weight 0 if using the Encumbrance rules). In addition, you can draw them with\na free action. So features that grant additional attacks can now be used for these omni-weapons without having to stow or draw\ndifferent weapons.</p>\n<p>Currently there isn't a replacement for the biotic powers (Biotic Push and Punch). These should be available as cantrips\nin the next update. We're also working on providing Engineers with a cantrip-like starting power which can also replace their omni-tool power.</p>\n<h3>Medi-gel</h3>\n<p>Medi-gel should have always been a healing potion instead of the weird mechanics using hit die. Again, the hit die mechanics were neat,\nbut unnecessarily complex.</p>\n<h3>Armor Proficiency</h3>\n<p>Another superfluous change was tying armor proficiency to race. This somewhat came from ME1 where certain armor types were only\navailable for certain races, but it didn't add enough to the game. Mechanically, all it did was force some races to take feats in order\nto play their class effectively. It also simply added a 5,000 credit price tag for most armor. No we're back in-line with 5e\nand all armor proficiency and starting equipment is on the class.</p>\n<h2>Skill changes</h2>\n<p>Finally, the skill changes were made to accomodate the upcoming Backgrounds and a large vehicle/space travel addition Swampson is working on.</p>\n<p>Details of all changes can be found in the <a href=\"/changelog\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1\">Feedback Welcome!</a></p>\n</section>\n"},fLVo:function(e,t){e.exports="<section><p>I randomly decided to checkout the analytics for this site and came across a surprising and exciting find: <em>people are\nvisiting this site!!!</em> It's not a ton of people, averaging ~30 a day. But this conversion seems to be generating interest,\nand that ain't nothing. Thus, I've got a renewed motivation (urgency?) to get some major work done in the next few months.\nAnd thanks to everyone who has taken a gander.</p>\n<p>But first...</p>\n<h2>A brief recap of our play test</h2>\n<p>We had 3 players with the following loadouts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drell Marksman Soldier</li>\n<li>Asari Justicar Adept</li>\n<li>Human Saboteur Infiltrator</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We ran a fast-paced session, testing the classes out on creatures,\nmobs I pulled straight from D&amp;D, bosses (a Banshee), and 2 fully spec'ed NPCs (Sentinel &amp; Engineer).\nWe leveled quickly so we could check out the classes at different phases. Specifically, level 5, 9 and 12.\nOverall, the flow, battle mechanics, spells, etc. all had the necessary feel of both ME and D&amp;D. I was excited to see\nthat they melded together nicely. I even started on a bestiary, creating monsters for various Reaper mobs, including\nMarauders, Cannibals, Husks, and a Banshee. If you're so inclined, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=19iMxTqyu7Vtyqy3I2-INWwurnXea_YuKzy7HbMZMuXw\">check out my prep notes</a>\nfor the very short campaign. <strong>Note</strong>: we didn't get to Operation Driftwood, and we chose Operation Metal Detector.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>I've been quietly working on a key aspect of any game system: <strong>balance</strong>. For the past months, I broken ye 'ole spreadsheets,\nworking on class analysis and overhauling the classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: Some classes vastly outperformed others.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: Classes peaked around level 9, with nominal damage increase beyond level 12.</p>\n<p>I found a D&amp;D class analysis in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIrEV1RFv6yxWEdqG6zP3z-ZONDTacquGyqYj8G-CdE\">The Optimists' Guide to D&amp;D 5E Damage by Class, Subclass, Weapon, and Level</a>.\nIt gave me a framework to review the ME classes. In doing the work, I also tried to align the classes more closely with\nD&amp;D counterparts. Soldiers became more like Fighters, Adepts like Wizards, Sentinels like Paladins. Other minor updates include\na better variety of weapons stats and improving/standardizing spell text.</p>\n<p>All in all, the next iteration will <em>look</em> similar but be a huge overhaul. Rest assured, I'll be sure to make the current\nversion available on the site, in case anyone is running a campaign.</p>\n<h2>Other things in the works</h2>\n<p>General site fixes, a bestiary, armor, adding new spells, printable spell cards, and adding some sort of &quot;NPC maker&quot;.</p>\n<p>This endeavor is far from over...</p>\n</section>\n"},igQt:function(e,t){e.exports='<section><p>In early 2017, I began listening to <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">The Adventure Zone</a>\nand became intrigued by D&amp;D 5th edition. \x3c!--more--\x3e Quick, tangential shout-out: if I threw in all my favorite books, music, movies,\netc into sorted list, TAZ would rank in the top 10. Seriously, you should be listening to it.</p>\n<p>You\'re probably wondering, &quot;How is it 2017 and you\'ve not played 5th Edition?&quot;. Well I\'m not a very experience TRPG\'er.\nUp to this point I\'d only gamed within Pinnacle\'s <a href="https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/">Savage Worlds</a> system.\nSo after a few episodes of TAZ, I got myself a 5e player\'s handbook and read that mofo cover to cover. What I enjoyed\nmost was the de-emphasis of strategic tabletop battling and the emphasis of creative problem-solving. Plus the simplicity\nof the die rolling was appealing:</p>\n<p><code>D20 + modifying_numbers &gt; target_number ? success : failure</code></p>\n<p>Though the game certainly gets more complicated, the base equation is simple enough for inexperienced players to wrap\ntheir heads around.</p>\n<p>Now, I enjoy a fantasy setting as much as the next nerd, but I\'d pick sci-fi over fantasy nine times out of ten. And what\'s\njust came out? That\'s right...<a href="https://www.masseffect.com/">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>. Mass Effect is one of my favorite sci-fi\nuniverses but it\'s got another key feature: the wizard, i.e., spellcasting. Plus, you have an entire <em>universe</em> to run a\ncampaign. You can focus on space exploration, fighting Reapers, policing the Milky Way, or mixing with the Citadel politics.</p>\n<p>So I got this crazy idea, <em>I want to play a TRPG Mass Effect</em>.\nMy current DM said, &quot;I think there are a few out there already.&quot; And, yeah, I found a few in various states of completion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete Works\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://masseffectd6.blogspot.com/">Mass Effect D6</a>, a Star Wars D6 conversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150629183534/http://masseffectrpg.org/wp/?page_id=51">Mass Effect Fate RPG</a>, a FATE conversion</li>\n<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5c7osZJmQnvQ09YVHFNaXdSLVk/edit">Mass Effect d20 system</a>, a OGL d20 conversion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Mass:_the_Effecting">Mass: the Effecting</a>, a nWoD conversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.pegforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=35981">Mass Effect: Ascension</a>, a Savage Worlds conversion</li>\n<li><a href="http://rpgcrank.blogspot.com/p/savage-worlds-mass-effect.html">Savage Worlds: Mass Effect</a>, Savage Worlds again.</li>\n<li><a href="https://destination-zero.obsidianportal.com/wikis/mass-effect-conversion-rules">A Mass Effect Game for Traveller</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I even found the beginnings of a <a href="https://edster504.wordpress.com">5e conversion</a>. Perhaps I\'m stubborn, or perhaps I\'m\na masochist, or perhaps these other options just don\'t have that 5e flair I crave. No matter the reason, I\'ve take the\nplunge, and that is how it starts.</p>\n</section>\n'},kixp:function(e,t,a){var n=a("oSoK");"string"==typeof n&&(n=[[e.i,n,""]]),n.locals&&(e.exports=n.locals);a("rjj0")("863c732e",n,!1,{sourceMap:!1})},oFgX:function(e,t){e.exports='<section><h2>Weapon Refactor</h2>\n<p>In a pre-version 1 iteration that was never published, the weapons stats were mapped from the <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons#Mass_Effect_3">ME3 weapon stats</a>.\nThen I did a lot of tinkering to add some variety to the weapons, but in doing so, I screwed everything up and made many weapons way to powerful.</p>\n<p>This refactor attempts to bring the weapons back in line to their stats, as well as add any additional effect the weapon had in-game.\nFor example, the <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M-37_Falcon">M-37 Falcon</a> is essentially a grenade launcher, but there was nothing in\nthis system that mirrored that mechanic. Now it has:</p>\n<pre><code>Instead of making a ranged weapon attack, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + DEX modifier). If you are\nproficient with Assault Rifles, add your proficiency bonus to the DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a successful one.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Damage was also scaled back, but not too much. Originally, the conversion was that all &quot;automatic&quot; weapons had a 5-6 Rate of Fire(RoF), but 5-6 damage die is A LOT.\nShotguns also had a high RoF accounting for the amount of bullets in a single blase, which created ambiguity between fire rate and bullet count.\nThree-round burst weapons has 3, Semi-auto has 2, and there were a few single shot, like sniper rifles. This also created a very large\nspread on the damage tables.</p>\n<p>In the refactor, there is a new weapon type: &quot;Semi-automatic&quot;. By default these only have an RoF of 1, but you can use your bonus\naction to fire another shot. This makes the standard D&amp;D 5e dual wielding mechanic more accessible, i.e., if you\'ve got a\nsemi-automatic weapon, you can make a second attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>Three-round burst weapons have an RoF of 3, and automatic and RoF of 4, with a few minor exceptions for weapons that had\nridiculously higher RoFs in the game like the Tempest SMG and a few Heavy Weapons.</p>\n<p>The end result is more generalized weapons by type that have enough variety in range, heat, and mechanic to make your choice fun:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assault Rifles: Vary more than any other weapon type but are generally automatic with lower heat and a medium range</li>\n<li>Heavy Pistols: Semi-automatic, light, with high heat and medium range</li>\n<li>Shotguns: Short range power houses with low heat but a variety of punch.</li>\n<li>SMGs: Short range, high RoF, low damage.</li>\n<li>Sniper rifles: Long range &amp; high damage with limited RoF and Heat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rare weapons have an increased cost (20k credits). This should make them unattainable to low level players and\ngives them a monetary cost to their awesomeness. Obviously, GMs can adjust cost to their needs.</p>\n<p>And finally, this version includes new melee weapons!</p>\n<p>Melee weapon attributes work exactly like their D&amp;D 5e counterparts (finesse, light, thrown, versatile, reach, etc). Most weapons have a special\nability as well. However, to replace the &quot;proficiency&quot; aspect of melee weapons (since there are so few), there is a STR requirement.\nAnyone can wield a melee weapon, but if you don\'t have the required STR mod (matching or above) your melee attacks with the weapon are\nmade at a disadvantage.</p>\n<h2>New Spells</h2>\n<p>A host of new spells and tech powers have been added. Primarily these were based on 5th edition, adding a bit more variety\nthan simple damage dealing abilities, and adding more options for Vanguards and Sentinels.</p>\n<h2>Spell damage</h2>\n<p>With a few exceptions, damage for all damage dealing biotic spells have been adjusted to fit the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrips: &lt; 10 avg damage</li>\n<li>1st Level: 10-15 avg damage</li>\n<li>2nd level: 15 - 22 avg damage</li>\n<li>3rd level: 20 - 28 avg damage</li>\n<li>4th level: 25-35 avg damage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This change was made to add a bit more scaling to the spells, as 4th level spells are effectively 6-7th level D&amp;D spells.</p>\n<h2>Class changes</h2>\n<p>A few class changes, primarily in name. Vanguards received some tweaking. Cabals are a very specific Turian Vanguard,\nso it didn\'t make much sense for them to be a subclass. Thus, Cabals have become Nemesis vanguards, a caster-oriented flavor.</p>\n<h2>New Race</h2>\n<p>Unshackled AI, a slight variant from Geth. Are you a rogue AI or a corporate masterpiece? You can decide with this versatile new race.</p>\n</section>\n'},oSoK:function(e,t,a){(e.exports=a("FZ+f")(!1)).push([e.i,"ol,ul{margin-left:2em}",""])},owLB:function(e,t,a){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var n=a("xGpK"),o=a("8lBT"),s=!1;var i=function(e){s||a("kixp")},r=a("VU/8")(n.a,o.a,!1,i,null,null);r.options.__file="pages/news/_slug.vue",t.default=r.exports},tzwd:function(e,t){e.exports='<section><h2>We\'re official (kind of...)</h2>\n<p>Tonight we launched our official site name: <a href="http://n7.world">n7.world</a>!</p>\n<p>You can also find us at <a href="http://masseffect5e.net">masseffect5e.net</a></p>\n<p>We waffled between n7.world and <a href="http://masseffect5e.net">masseffect5e.net</a>, landed on the former for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It\'s easy to remember</li>\n<li>\'N7\' is a classic and recognizable Mass Effect reference, almost synonymous with the game itself</li>\n<li>\'World\' elicits the idea of roleplaying and being a piece in a larger galaxy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Truth be told, I hastily pushed this change out and even fixed a few links while I was actively running a weekly campaign\n(<em>shame on me as a GM!</em>).
