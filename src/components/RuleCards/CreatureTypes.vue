      p.
        There aren't enough spells and powers to justify making bonuses like "double damage to beast". In addition, many of the 5th Edition
        creature types don't make sense in the sci-fi setting (celestials, undead, fey, elemental, etc.). Instead there are only
        three creatue types: Organic, Synthetic, and Synthorganic.
      p.
        Some abilities only effect organic or synthetic creatures (or deal increased damage to that type), as notated in the ability text.
        Synthorganic creatures are considered both synthetic and organic.
