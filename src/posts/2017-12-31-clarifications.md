Overall, [Swampson](https://github.com/Swampson) has helped me fix my wording can clarify a lot of rules that didn't make sense
or were ambiguous. I'm deputizing him at the official "Copy Editor" of this project, whether he likes it or not.

## Spell changes

The major changes to be aware of is the increase to biotic spell damage. I goofed in my previous version and WAY
undercut the power of the spells. Now the average spell damage should align to the following: __Level__,`Single Target Dmg`,`AoE Dmg`

* __Cantrip__: `5.5`, `3.5`
* __1st-lvl__: `13.5`, `10.5`
* __2nd-lvl__: `30`, `22.5`
* __3rd-lvl__: `49.5`, `33`
* __4th-lvl__: `63`, `43.5`

The reason for the changes, is that a 4th level spell is effectively an 7th/8th level spell in 5th edition.

## Armor Sets
A big addition in 0.4.0 is the pre-made Armor Sets. They're cheaper than creating custom armor, but lack the ability to be customized.

## Starting equipment
Due to the addition to the armor sets, each race also has a starting weapon and armor. Each race has the option of rolling for credits to buy their own equipment.
Every die count/die type combination averages to about 25,000 credits. But based on lifespan, you may get roll more or less die.
The reasoning is that long-lived (asari, krogan) races have a higher chance to be average in their monetary gains . Whereas, short-lived
races (salarians, vorcha) have a higher probability of either being in their peak or low of their monetary gains. Since it's just
a starting roll, it shouldn't effect gameplay too much. It was a nice way to factor in that flavor. The only exceptions are Volus, who only start with money
and Geth/Unshackled AI, who effectively don't need to purchase armor, so start with less.

## Armor Mod Overhaul
I've finally rounded out and standardized the the available armor mods. In addition, there are also detailed instructions
for creating armor mods in the armor rules section. So feel free to create your own!

## Feedback form
And finally, I've added a [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1) so anyone can provide feedback without having to make a Github account.

As always, be sure to review the [changelog](https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for all
the changes. Sorry for the short post. Swampson and I are working on a couple of pretty significant additions that
I'm hoping to get out in the next few weeks.
