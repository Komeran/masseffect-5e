+2 grenade capacity
Improvised Grenades. You can make grenades from scrap metal and scavenged materials. Acquire 1 frag grenade every long rest.
When you use a grenade, you may choose to make a ranged weapon attack on a creature instead of choosing a target location. Add your dexterity modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
On a hit, the grenade deals 1d4 + dexterity modifier bludgeoning damage to the target and it has disadvantage on the saving throw caused by the grenade. The grenade lands at the target's location.,On a miss, the grenade lands 2m beyond the target.,On a critical miss, roll 2d4. The first die represents the number of spaces away from the target in which the grenade lands. The second die represents the direction (1 = North, 2= East, 3 = South, 4 = West). E.g., 2 & 2, the grenade would land 2 spaces east of the target.
Once the grenade's location is determined, it resolves normally.
