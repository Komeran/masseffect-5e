The game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each
character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,
racial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best
party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.
The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.

The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure features a fantastic
setting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras
in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.

Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations
that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture
each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And
often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the
current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what
they’ll try to do next.

Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no
more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other
challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end
of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of
their labors.

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of
multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group
of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.

### The Three Pillars of Adventure

__Exploration__ includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations
that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters
to do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the
characters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city's transit tube. On
the smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on console to see what happens.

__Social interaction__ features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a
captured soldier reveal the passcode to the enemies stronghold, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for
mercy from an krogan chieftain, or persuading a talkative unshackled AI to unlock a navigation route to a distant planet.

The rules in <a href="needsLink!!!">Using Ability Scores</a> and <a href="needsLink!!!">Adventuring</a> support exploration
and social interaction, as do many class features in <a href="needsLink!!!">Classes</a> and personality traits
in <a href="needsLink!!!">Personality and Backgrounds</a>.

__Combat__, the focus of the <a href="needsLink!!!">Combat</a> section, involves characters and other creatures
shooting weapons, casting biotics and tech, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents,
whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a
game session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a
pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing one a drone,
to examine the environment (perhaps by pushing a very large red button), and to interact with other creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.
