title: 'Biotics'

Biotics is the ability of some lifeforms to create mass effect fields using element zero nodules embedded in body
tissues. These powers are accessed and augmented by using bio-amps. Biotic individuals can knock enemies over from a
distance, lift them into the air, generate gravitational vortices to tear obstacles or enemies apart, or create
protective barriers.



### Spell Level
Every biotic spell has a level from 0 to 5. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the
lowly (but still impressive) lance at 1st level and the earth-shaking Storm at 4th. __Cantrips__ - simple but powerful spells
that characters can cast almost by rote - are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must
be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level,
not 5th level, to cast a 5th-level spell.



### Known Spells
Biotics rely on physical mnemonics and a biotic implant to harness the power of mass effect fields. Learning the mnemonics
takes years of practice. Once mastered, biotic users can learn new varieties of controlling the fields. As biotic characters
progress in levels, they learn knew varieties of biotic spells or can augment the power or utility of an existing one.
In any case, once a biotic user learns a spell, it is always at their disposal.



#### Advancing Spells <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
The class progression tables indicate when a class learns a new Biotic spell. In Mass Effect 5e, characters can choose
to augment a spell they've already learned rather than learning a new one.

Once you've selected an advancement option, you cannot advance the spell again. In addition, you cannot learn and advance an
ability in the same level. For example, 1st-level Adepts can learn up to three 1st-level, biotic spells. They cannot
learn two spells and advance one.



### Spell Slots
Regardless of how many spells a biotic knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting.
Manipulating the gravitational forces into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells
are even more so. Thus, each biotic class's description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level
a character can use at each character level.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot
with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a
spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 4th-level spell fits only in a 4th-level slot.
So when an adept casts lance, a 1st-level spell, he or she spends one 1st-level slots.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots, as found in higher
levels of the adept class.



### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher
level for that casting. For instance, if an adept casts lance using one of their 2nd-level slots, that lance is 2nd level.
Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as lance and warp, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.



### Casting in Armor
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for biotic spellcasting, you must be proficient with the
armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.



### Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the
biotic's muscle memory allowing them to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.
