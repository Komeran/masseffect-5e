Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The
Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, and Science skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

throw DCs of spells they cast.
