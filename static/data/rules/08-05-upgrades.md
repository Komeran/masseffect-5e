Operative can use their credits to upgrade their shipâ€™s systems. You can also add an additional system, provided
the ship has the necessary space for it. This will be indicated in the ships system description section.

Each upgrade has a prerequisite of all previous upgrades. For example, to install the Level-III upgrade for your
weapons system, you must first purchase and install the Level-I and Level-II upgrades.

Installing an upgrade takes 8 hours of uninterrupted work. You can either pay a skilled hireling for a days work
or you can make the upgrades yourself.
