Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to
use. Whether you favor an assault rifle or a sword, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the
difference between life and death while on a mission.

The <nuxt-link to="/phb/weapons">Weapons List</nuxt-link> shows the available weapons, their price and weight, the damage
they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged.
A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 2 meters of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at
a distance.



### Weapon Proficiency <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>
You must be proficient with a weapon type to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. There are 7 distinct weapon
types and all weapons fall into one of the following types.

- __Assault Rifles__. The most common weapons of the military. These are generall medium-range weapons that dealt average damage with a high heat capacity.
- __Heavy Pistols__. The most common gun type in the Mass Effect universe. Simple but effective.
- __Sub-machine Guns (SMGS)__. Single-handed, rapid fire weapons that have a short range.
- __Shotguns__. Close-range, high-damage blasts.
- __Sniper Rifles__. Precision instruments meant for long range or stealthy combat.
- __Melee__. Used in close-quarters combat. _Damage resulting from melee weapon attacks by-pass shields_.
- __Heavy Weapons__. Specialty weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. _Heavy Weapons do not have a proficiency requirement_.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons List.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes
any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to
a club (melee weapon). At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were
that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).
If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,
it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 10 meters and a long range of 30 meters.


### Thermal Clips <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
Ranged weapons (guns) use thermal clips to abate heat. All thermal clips are interchangeable between weapons. More information
about using thermal clips can be found below.


### Heavy Weapons <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
Heavy Weapons use Charges to track the number of times they can be fired. If you run out of Charges your weapon is nothing more than a hunk of metal.

#### Targeting
Most Heavy Weapons also use the Targeting condition. Targeting means painting the battlefield, or keeping a lock on one or more creatures for
a single round of combat. Targeting is considered a free action, as long as you've already drawn the heavy weapon,
i.e., you can choose to pick-up or equip a weapon as your action, then begin targeting as a free action before your turn ends.
If you're already holding the weapon, you might use an ability as your action and then begin targeting.



### Carrying, Stowing, and Drawing Weapons <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
You can carry 2 weapons into combat unless a feature or armor mod allows you to carry more. If using the Variant: Encumbrance
rule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.

You can holster the weapon you're wielding and draw a weapon you're carrying as a bonus action. This is true for all weapon types.


### Weapon Mods <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip>
Weapons can be improved by adding _weapon mods_. Each weapon has 4 mod slots: Magazine, Body, Core, and Barrel.
The weapon is only allowed one mod per slot. For example, the M-8 Avenger cannot have the Ultralight Materials and the
Precision Scope, because both of those mods utilize the Body slot. Unlike armor mods, weapon mods can be removed from
weapons without any damage to the weapon or mod. In this example, the player could choose to replace Ultralight Materials for the Precision Scope.

Additionally, some mods are limited by weapon type. For example, the Stunner mod is only available for placement on Heavy
Pistols and SMGs.

You cannot add weapon mods to _special_ or _melee_ weapons.
