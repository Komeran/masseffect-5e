Omni-gel is composed of common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys kept in a semi-molten state.
It is designed for use with omni-tools to do electronics and decryption work, make general repairs, and even craft new upgrades.
Each "charge" of omni-gel is stored in a canister and is worth 1,000 credits.
