For characters that want to create unique armor pieces, they can craft or purchase upgradable armor pieces. To craft armor
pieces, your character needs to be proficient with Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools. Then they must spend the necessary
amount of time and omni-gel as listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table. _Note: it takes much less time and resources to craft
these basic armor pieces than it does to craft armor sets due to the simplicity of the armor you character is creating_.

Characters may instead purchase customizable armor for the cost listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table.

Once you have creafted or purchased your armor piece, it is time to add benefits to the armor using __armor mods__. Each
piece of customizable armor has a set number of mod slots and you can add additional slots (up to the maximum) for more
time and omni-gel (if crafting) or credits (if purchasing). You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest,
head, legs, or arms.
