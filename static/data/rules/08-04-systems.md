Systems are the semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of the vehicle. But systems also refer
or a "place" within the vehicle where crucial operations must be performed. For example, to pilot the vehicle,
you typically have to be at the helm, and to fire the weapons, you have to be at the terminal that controls the cannons
or targeting system. In some cases, a vehicle might have a __combined system__, e.g. _Helm/Navigation/SSC_. When two
or more systems are combined, operatives can access their functions from a single (or sometimes multiple) locations.

### Helm
The helm is the pilot seat. Players at the helm are able to take the Maneuver action, which can temporarily increase the
AC of their starship or vehicle, representing the pilot’s ability to evade oncoming attacks.

### Navigation
A starships navigation system is necessary to plot jumps between Mass Effect Relays. More about using your ships
navigation can be found in the Travelling the Galaxy section below.

### Weapons
Players must be at the weapons system to take the Attack action in combat. Weapon damage for vehicles has a x10 modifier.
Starships have a x100 modifier.

### EWS (Electronic Warfare Suite)
The ships EWS protects the vehicle from hacking attempts but also allows the crew to attempt to hack other ships.
Players must be a the EWS system to take the Harden or Sabotage action in combat.

### SSC (Sensors, Scanners, and Communications)
Every vehicle comes with at least some modicum of sensors, scanners, and communication systems. Sensors and scanners
allow players to scan planets and satellites for composites and valuable materials. Comms allow the vehicle to hail
other ships and planets. Players must be at the Sensors systems to take the Scan action during combat.

### Drive
The drive and engineering deck are the heart of the ship. Damage to a ship’s drive can render it immobile and shutdown
other vital systems. Players at the Engineering system can attempt the Restore action in combat.

### Additional Systems
In addition to the standard systems, starships can have additional quarters, workshops, and labs on board. Below is
a list of common systems and their benefits but GMs can make additional systems as they see fit.

Each system also provides a list of Downtime Activities, meaning players can participate in one of the Downtime Activity
listed while on board the ship during a long rest. The Downtime Training has a list of tool and/or weapon proficiencies
that can be learned from participating in the <nuxt-link to="needsLink!!!">Downtime Activity: Training</nuxt-link>.

#### Additional Starship System

__Armory__. Acts as a Weapon and Armor workbench for the purposes of installing equipment mods (weapons and armor). _Downtime Activity_ - Crafting, Training (armorsmith’s workbench, tailor’s tools, tinker’s tools, weaponsmith’s workbench)

__Medbay__. When onboard the ship, players that expend a hit die on a short rest gain the maximum possible hit points. _Downtime Activity_ - Practice a Profession, Training (medical kit)

__Exonet__. Advantage on Investigation and History checks made while onboard. _Downtime Activity_ - Practice a Profession, Research, Training (hacking tools)

__Luxury Kitchen__. When you roll a d6 to determine how many crew become disgruntled, subtract 1 from the roll. _Downtime Activity_ - Training (brewer’s supplies, chemist’s supplies, cook’s utensils)

__Rec Room__. When you roll a d6 to determine how many crew become disgruntled, subtract 2 from the roll. _Downtime Activity_ - Training (disguise kit, gaming set, musical instrument, painter’s supplies)

__Weapon Range__. _Downtime Activity_ - Training in additional weapon proficiencies

__VR Training__. _Downtime Activity_ - Training (any starship system, vehicles)

__Crash couches__. When you succeed on a Hard Maneuver, characters on board your ship have advantage on their Constitution saving throw.

### Upgrades
Operative can use their credits to upgrade their ship’s systems. You can also add an additional system, provided
the ship has the necessary space for it. This will be indicated in the ships system description section.

Each upgrade has a prerequisite of all previous upgrades. For example, to install the Level-III upgrade for your
weapons system, you must first purchase and install the Level-I and Level-II upgrades.

Installing an upgrade takes 8 hours of uninterrupted work. You can either pay a skilled hireling for a days work
or you can make the upgrades yourself.

### Maintaining Systems
Every system requires maintenance, and vehicle systems are no different. For larger vehicles, like starships,
your maintenance is generally performed by your __crew__. Every system requires at least 16 hours of maintenance per month.
Maintenance can be performed by a skilled hireling for 3000 credits over 2 long rests, or over time by a dedicated crew
member (as discussed below).

#### Replacing systems
If a system breaks and must be replaced, you loose any upgrades to that system and must purchase a new one for 300,000
credits.
