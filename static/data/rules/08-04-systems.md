### Helm
The helm is the pilot seat. Players at the helm are able to take the Maneuver action, which can temporarily increase the
AC of their starship or vehicle, representing the pilot’s ability to evade oncoming attacks.

### Navigation
A starships navigation system is necessary to plot jumps between Mass Effect Relays. More about using your ships
navigation can be found in the Travelling the Galaxy section below.

### Weapons
Players must be at the weapons system to take the Attack action in combat. Weapon damage for vehicles has a x10 modifier.
Starships have a x100 modifier.

### EWS (Electronic Warfare Suite)
The ships EWS protects the vehicle from hacking attempts but also allows the crew to attempt to hack other ships.
Players must be a the EWS system to take the Harden or Sabotage action in combat.

### SSC (Sensors/Scanners/Communications)
Every vehicle comes with at least some modicum of sensors, scanners, and communication systems. Sensors and scanners
allow players to scan planets and satellites for composites and valuable materials. Comms allow the vehicle to hail
other ships and planets. Players must be at the Sensors systems to take the Scan action during combat.

### Drive/Engineering
The drive and engineering deck are the heart of the ship. Damage to a ship’s drive can render it immobile and shutdown
other vital systems. Players at the Engineering system can attempt the Restore action in combat.

### Additional Systems
In addition to the standard systems, starships can have additional quarters, workshops, and labs on board. Below is
a list of common systems and their benefits but GMs can make additional systems as they see fit.

Each system also provides a list of Downtime Activities, meaning players can participate in one of the Downtime Activity
listed while on board the ship during a long rest. The Downtime Training has a list of tool and/or weapon proficiencies
that can be learned from participating in the Downtime Activity: Training.
