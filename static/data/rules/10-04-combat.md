Combat spells rely on gadgets, physical devices, special equipment or even overriding safety protocols on armor or weapons.


### Known Spells
Combat spells represent the acquisition of learning a talent, closer to class features than actual spells. When
you learn a combat spell, it is always at your disposal.


#### Advancing Spells
The class progression tables indicate when a class learns a new Combat spell. Characters can choose
to augment a spell they've already learned rather than learning a new one.

Once you've selected an advancement option, you cannot advance the spell again. In addition, you cannot learn and advance an
ability in the same level.


### Casting Costs
Combat spells have limitations in the number of times you can use them per short and long rest and do not cost a resource
like a spell slot or tech point.


### Higher Levels
Combat spells do not have "higher level" casts. Instead, they become more powerful based on the characters total level, much
like a cantrip.


### Attack action
Many Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If
a spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.
