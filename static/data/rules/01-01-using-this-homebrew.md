Mass Effect 5e is a homebrew for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition which allows you to play a tabletop roleplaying game
with D&D 5th edition rules but set in the Mass Effect Universe. If you have played 5th edition, many of the rules
and rule syntax will feel familiar to you. For your convenience, completely new rules will be tagged with a New badge. This
indicates either an entire new rule or mechanic or a change in an existing rule.

For entirely new players (i.e., players who have not played 5th edition), you will find the entirey of 5th edition's
System Reference Document (SRD) included in this homebrew. The purpose of including the SRD it to make it easier for
new and veteran players to reference the rules of 5th edition when using this homebrew.

Since D&D 5th edition is primarily focused on a fantasy setting, the components of the SRD have been "reskinned." Where,
the SRD may reference and Orc, Kingdom, or galley, this version will reference a Drell, Planet, or starship. However, you
can also read through the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">official SRD</a>.
