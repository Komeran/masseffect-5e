There isn't any traditional fantasy "magic" in Mass Effect 5e but there are super-powered abilities, advanced technology,
and fantastic items. Mass Effect 5e retains the word "spell" as a catch-all to describe special powers that are available
to the game's classes.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions,
drain life energy away, and restore health to the injured.


### Spell Types
Mass Effect divided spells into 3 distinct categories:

#### Biotics
These function similarly to 5th edition spell: Spells have levels which indicate their power, and your character has
a number of spell slots which they use to cast the spell.

#### Tech
Tech spells are fueled by the character's Omni-tool which uses micro-fabricators to create seemingly magical effects like
fiery blasts or electric shocks.

#### Combat Powers
Combat powers have no casting cost, as they are generally instantiated by some sort of gadget or device. Instead of a
casting cost, combat powers recharge on a short or long rest.
