A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or hack
a security system. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a
tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

Mass Effect 5e utilizes the Tool Proficiency rules found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything (pg. 78). In summary, it's
unclear when a player should use a tool proficiency and a skill proficiency. The rule of thumb is that tools have
specific applications whereas skills are very broad, but this limits the use of tools.

Thus, to make tool proficiencies more attractive, Xanathar's Guide to Everything added benefits to combining tools with
skills. The first is that combining a tool with a skill gives the player advantage when making the skill check.
The second benefit is that tools provide additional non-combat features.

For example, a character that is proficient with Hacking Tools gains advantage when combining their tool proficiency
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check when utilizing networked systems (like the exonet). The same character
can perform activities during a short rest such as falsifying electronic documents.
