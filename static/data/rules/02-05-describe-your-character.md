title: '4. Describe Your Character'
---

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character
needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in the [Personality and Background](needsLink!!!) section, you can flesh out your character’s
physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her
decisions) and ideals. The Personality and Background section also helps you identify the things your character holds
most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character’s background describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place
in the galaxy. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in this system, and might be willing
to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might
also give you additional proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality
information you develop, on your character sheet.

#### Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very
strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might
be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly
and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low
Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence
might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with
low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A
character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4</strong><br>
Sam fills in some of Kaleems’s basic details: her name, her sex (female), her height and weight, and her alignment (chaotic neutral).
Her high Intelligence suggest an rapid focused mind, higher Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body,
and her low Charisma suggests stand-offish or awkward social decorum.

Sam decides that Kaleem comes from a lowly background, rummaging the slums of Omega. When she was caught stealing equipment
from the Blue Suns, the general spared her life b ut put her to work scrapping and repairing weapons, mechs, and other tech.
Sam chooses the scrapper background fro Kaleem. She notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives her.

Sam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper
background, noting instead that Kaleem is a aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers, but fiercely loyal to her friends.
She chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the universe
is change.

Given her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lack empathy which
has caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.
