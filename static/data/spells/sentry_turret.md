Spend 5 tech points to construct a sentry turrent in an unoccupied space within 2m.
You have complete control over the turret. Any hacking attempts on the turret are rolled against your intelligence, not the turret's.
The turret has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.
The turret lasts until its hit points become 0 or lower or until you use a bonus action to destroy it.
