Spend X tech points to summon a holographic copy of yourself at a location within 10m. Until the spell ends, the decoy moves with you and mimics your actions. You can use your action to dismiss the decoy.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, it must first make a Wisdom (Perception) check. The DC of this check is equal to your spell save + X. On a failed save, a creature attacks the decoy. On a success, the creature ignores the decoy, attacks you, and no longer needs to pass the Wisdom check to target you.
