Spend 1 tech point to tap into the VI of a willing creature. Once within the next 10 minutes, the target can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to one ability check, saving throw, or attack roll of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the roll.
You may only have Guidance on one target at a time.
