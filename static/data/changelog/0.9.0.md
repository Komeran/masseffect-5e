## Classes
Looking back at the history of the changelog, I realized that classes had become pretty wild. My initial approach to creating
classes had been: start with a 5th edition concept and plug in features from other classes that seem to work. Essentially,
this was horrible game design.

Each class and subclass needs a concept. In some cases the translation from 5th
edition to Mass Effect was easy and the concept was well defined. Adepts are a great example, they're glass-cannons. Each
adpet subclass also had a unified concept. Commandos dish out huge amounts of single target damage, focusing on
force-type biotic powers. Blackstars were control experts. Disruptors had the most AoE potential and had benefits to
necrotic powers. Unfortunately, all the other classes and subclasses fell short (with a few exceptions).

The engineers were severely underpowered. This was an inherent problem with the variable (X-cost) casting mechanic.
The infiltrator subclasses looked like I'd taken all of the rogue subclasses, shaken them up in a bag, and randomly drew out some features
from each. One major oversight was that infiltrators lacked a true sniper rifle class, which was their primary weapon in
the Mass Effect games. Soldiers seemed uninspired. Vanguards had everything plus the kitchen sink thrown into their progression tables.
And sentinels felt too much like a multiclasses engineer/adept.

Therefore, classes have received a number of significant changes. For each class and subclass, I started with a concept and made sure the
base class reflected that concept. The base class concepts are rooted in how the class played in the Mass Effect games.
The subclasses are unique creations that focus on a particular aspect of the base class.

### Adepts
The adepts were generally fine and should feel like they did in v0.8.4. However the number of spell slots has been
reduced to match the spell progression of "full-casters" in 5th edition (clerics, druids, bards, sorcerers, wizards).
Instead of set levels in which an Adept learns new spells, they can learn new spells at every level, giving them many
more opportunities to advance their arsenal.

### Engineers
__Concept__: Versatile casters.
__Subclass Concepts__: Drones, Healing, Strategy

The Engineer tech point system has been overhauled. Instead of tech spells having a variable cost, tech spells have spell
levels. Engineers use tech points to cast those spells, requiring one tech point for each level of the spell they want to cast:
1 tp = 1st level, 2tp = 2nd level, etc. This is a very minor change to 5th editions spell slot system, but it gives the
engineers a greater amount of versatility. Should I keep casting pot shots for 1 tech point? Or should I pump all of
my tech points into a spell for a huge payoff. This makes engineers adaptable to any situation.

__Drone Jockey__
Drone Jockeys remain unchanged.

__Medic__
Medics remain unchanged.

__Mastermind__
Masterminds are always one step ahead of their enemies. Moved from the Sentinel class, masterminds are highly-intellectual and skilled individuals.
- _enfilade_ detonate primed enemies with your reaction, setting up the perfect combo
- _jack of all trades_ general ability in all skills
- _extra attack_
- _tactical advantage_ grants you bot advancement options for all your advanced spells, making any strategy possible
- _spell steal_ is your ultimate trump card against other casters

### Infiltrators
__Concept__: Stealthy combatants that fight from the shadows. The parity between Rogues and Infiltrators is self-evident, so the infiltrator base class is heavily based on rogues.
__Subclass Concepts__: Melee, Sabotage, Sniper Rifles

Though Infiltrators had a number of interesting combat options, Tactical Cloak proved too powerful to pass up in playtesting.
Each round of an infiltrators turn consisted of Attack, Tactical Cloak, Move. With tactical cloak always on,
the infiltrator rarely suffered damage could always apply their sneak attack damage. This made for rather boring combat.

Another issues was multiclassing an Engineer with 2 levels of Infiltrator provided more opportunities for tactical cloak
than a full infiltrator.

To fix these issues, Tactical Cloak uses are limited to two users per short rest, increasing as the infiltrator levels.

__Shadow__
Focus on melee attacks, closing distance, and sneaking up on targets.
- _up close and personal_ increases your sneak attack damage with melee weapons
- _silent cloak_ allows you to close distance without being noticed.
- _melee prowess_ improves your melee weapon attacks and damage
- _shadow strike_ improves your tactical cloak, allowing you to close distance, escape movement impairing effects, and strike targets
- _death strike_ grants an opportunity to deal devastating damage with a single opening attack

__Sniper__
Focus on using sniper rifles, giving infiltrators a subclass that references their Mass Effect counterpart
- _steady aim_ a powerful feature making this subclass deadly with a sniper rifle
- _careful eyes_ find targets even when they're hidden
- _overwatch_ monitor the battlefield and attack any creature that tries to move out of cover
- _killshot_ improved sneak attack damage with sniper rifles.

__Saboteur__
Saboteurs control the battlefield using distractions, tech powers, and sabotage. Very similar to arcane tricksters.
- _saboteur's touch_ sabotage enemy weapons
- _combat heuristics_ regain tech points every time you take down an enemy
- _tactical ambush_ increase the effectiveness of your spells when you use them from tactical cloak
- _misdirection_ make sure you're never hit in combat again
- _saboteur's reflexes_ rule the first round of combat by taking two turns

### Sentinels
__Concept__: Tanks and combat leaders
__Subclass concepts__: Leadership, Survivability, Support

Sentinels felt too much like a multi-classed adept and engineer. The new sentinel progression attempts to provide a
unique spellcasting experience for the class, utilizing the warlock progression from 5th edition.

Tech Armor was proving too powerful at high levels, granting as much as 300 additional hit points. The number of uses
per long rest has been reduced to 2.

Finally, the stat split for sentinels is over. Choosing between Wisdom and Intelligence was too much of a hindrance
and didn't make sense with the simplified spell system. Charisma is now a sentinel's spellcasting modifier.

__Bastion__
Bastions are combat leaders. Their features are based on the Warlord concept from Mike Mearls. Whereas masterminds
focus on increasing their own combat potential, bastions focus on increasing the potential of their party members.
- _master tactician_ increases the range of Help action and allows it as a bonus action
- _tactical focus_ choose an area of the battlefield and apply a unique tactic, the number of tactics and size of the area increases as you level
- _every ready_ make sure you're never surprised again and keep yourself at the top of the initiative order
- _call the shots_ sacrifice your action to bolster your allies and inhibit your enemies
- _tactical maneuvers_ direct your troops around the battle field
- _synchronized assault_ give your allies an additional action

__Juggernaut__
Juggernauts are living tanks, nearly impossible to kill.
- _assault armor_ keep the action on you
- _hardened tech armor_ increased ac and nullify critical hits
- _advanced tech armor_ keep your tech armor alive by gaining hit points when you cast spells
- _unyielding assault_ avoid becoming paralyzed, stunned, or frozen
- _adaptive tech armor_ gain resistance to the last type of damage you took

__Guardian__
Ultimate support specialists. They can buff the party but their expertise helps in non-combat situations. Overall, guardians
remain similar to their previous iterations. The primary change is that they are no longer limited to learn specific auras,
and their auras last 10 minutes.

### Soldiers
__Concept__: Weapon masters and combat experts.
__Subclass Concepts__: Combat Prowess, Weapon focus, EXPLOSIONS!!!

__Havoc Subclass__
Havoc soldiers do just that, cause havoc. They do so by using grenades, heavy weapons, and more powerful combat powers.
- _advanced weapon holsters_ allow havoc soldiers to bring more guns into a fight
- _makeshift grenades_ never run out of grenades again, use your omni-gel to create new ones
- _advanced combat powers_ do more with your combat powers
- _heavy weapon hack_ never run out of heavy weapon charges, use your omni-gel to create new ones
- _make shift grenades_ program new grenades into your omni-tool, and use grenades as an attack
- _paint by number_ target and fire your heavy weapons in the same round.

__Weapon Master__
Weapon masters specialize in a single weapon. Mostly unchanged from the previous version, except their superiority die-type
increases with their level.

__Gladiator__
Based on the Samurai of 5th Edition's Unearthed Arcana, Gladiators revel in te challenge of combat and are extremely
difficult to kill. Their fighting spirit gives them incredible advantage in combat and can even prevent death.


### Vanguards
__Concept__: war-casters that use high-risk, high-reward tactics
__Subclass Concepts__: Melee, Shotguns & Charge, Biotic Powers

Vanguards spellcasting has been adjusted to "half-caster" level (paladins & rangers), requiring more emphasis on barrier
manipulation and close-quarter combat. However the nemesis subclass was reworked to provide a ranged option for vanguards
with unique biotic talents.

Vanguards can also learn combat powers instead of learning new cantrips.

__Battle Master__
Battle masters use their barrier ticks to create unique opportunities in combat. New features have been introduced that
increase their melee combat potential.
- _biotic maneuvers_ unique talents that can be applied using barrier ticks
- _biotic focus_ greatly increase your melee combat potential
- _improved barrier_ increase the potency of your barrier
- _extra attack_ gain an additional attack with this subclass,
- _opportunist_ use your reaction to strike creatures that have been hit with other attacks

__Shock Trooper__
Shock troopers are built around the charge cantrip, jumping from enemy to enemy, and closing distance for shotgun blasts.
- _biotic bull rush_ improves the charge cantrip and grants an additional weapoin attack
- _stunning strike_ further improves the charge cantrip by adding a potential stun
- _shotgun savvy_ allows you to apply brutal critical and zero-sum to your shotgun attacks
- _onslaught_ greatly improves the damage of charge
- _a touch of force_ adds a bonus to weapon attacks
- _blitz_ lets you use charge as a reaction

__Nemesis__
Nemesis vanguards focus on biotic powers and range. While they lack the biotic potential of adepts, they make up for it with survivability.
- _biotic recovery_ regenerates spell slots
- _metabiotics_ grants powerful augmentations to your biotic spells
- _biotic attacks_ take advantage of your extra attack by reducing the casting time of specific spells to an attack
- _biotic fury_ apply the benefits of zero-sum and brutal critical to your biotic spells
- _teleporting dodge_ stay out of harms way
- _bombardment_ deal even more damage with your biotic spells
