The harbinger can only assume control of one creature at a time. While it is assuming control, its speed becomes 0, attacking creatures have advantage, it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and it cannot cast any spells. If the harbinger is incapacitated, assume control ends. The harbinger can use its bonus action to end assume control. As a result, the targeted creature loses all benefits including any temporary hit points and barrier ticks."
