At the {{ level }} level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature 
you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you're wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with 
that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your soldier level.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
