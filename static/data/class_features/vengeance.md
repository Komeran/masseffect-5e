Starting at {{ level }} level, your biotic mastery allows you to overcome grievous injuries. When you would make a death 
saving throw, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of biotic energy. You immediately stand up (if you so 
choose), and you regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. All hostile creatures within 10m of you take 
10 + your spellcasting ability modifier necrotic damage and are {poisoned} until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
