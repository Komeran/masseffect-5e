Your suit is your lifeblood. It makes your immune to disease. You have resistance to poison and necrotic damage. However, if you are {unprotected} and receive a critical hit, your suit becomes breached. On your turn, you can take no other action except expending a charge of specialized sealant to close the puncture. You have 3 charges of sealant.  On a long rest, you regain your charges.
For each hour in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer one level of exhaustion. For each hour you spend outside of your suit if not in a compatible environment, suffer 3 levels of exhaustion.
