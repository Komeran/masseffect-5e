excerpt: A quick but exciting update

## We're official (kind of...)

Tonight we launched our official site name: [n7.world](http://n7.world)!

You can also find us at [masseffect5e.net](http://masseffect5e.net)

We waffled between n7.world and masseffect5e.net, landed on the former for the following reasons:
1. It's easy to remember
2. 'N7' is a classic and recognizable Mass Effect reference, almost synonymous with the game itself
3. 'World' elicits the idea of roleplaying and being a piece in a larger galaxy.


Truth be told, I hastily pushed this change out and even fixed a few links while I was actively running a weekly campaign
(_shame on me as a GM!_). So if there are any issues you come across you can either use the [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/3wZj8QhlsLv3XOJw1)
__OR!__ ping me on my fresh email: [luke@n7.world](mailto:luke@n7.world)

I've got more system updates coming out next weekend at the latest. As word spreads about this system, we continue to gain a group
of active contributors who are generating a ton of great new ideas.

Thanks to everyone!
