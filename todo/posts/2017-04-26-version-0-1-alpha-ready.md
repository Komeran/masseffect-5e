Version 0.1.0-alpha means this bad boy is just getting started. But it's at a point where I'm ready for the first 
playtest (scheduled for June 2). Anyone who stumbles upon this site should feel free to play test as well and use whatever
to start a campaign, but note that things will be a-changin' a lot.

But in a month, we've come a long way. All the spells, classes, and races are spec'ed out. Though multiple play tests we'll
need to work on balancing the system. There's also a lot of unknowns:

- Will the shield mechanic be a pain in the ass to track?
- What about the weapons? Are they too overpowered? Underpowered compared to abilities?
- Should classes be able to cast more or less?

Already I know that some classes feel less desirable and interesting than others. I worked on the Vanguard and Sentinel last
so they benefited from a month of learning and refactoring. All the Adept classes seem a little underwhelming, but this might
be balanced by their ability to take and cast the most spells.

But at this point, any changes would be entirely guesswork. So...ONWARD! TO PLAY TESTING!
